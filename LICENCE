                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
 charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
 or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
 use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
 these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
 rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) use the copyright to guarantee everyone else the same freedoms
 that we have.

 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
 rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

 Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
 copyright the software, and (2) use the copyright to guarantee
 everyone else the same freedoms that we have.

 Consequently, you need to make sure that everyone else also has these
 freedoms. For example, you must share alike when you distribute the
 modified version.

 Also, for each copyright holder, the GPL allows the use of the
 software in a way that is both fair and transparent. If the software
 is modified, the GPL requires that the modified version is also
 licensed under the GPL.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
 of works, such as semiconductor masks.

 “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
 “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

 “Complete Source Code” means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it. “Source Code” means the source code for a
 work, including any associated interface definition files, plus the
 scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
 executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
 distributed does not need to include anything that is normally
 distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.

 “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the
 source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
 to control those activities. It also includes the source code for
 shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
 specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
 communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
 parts of the work.

 “The Library” refers to a work of authorship that, taken alone,
 would be a library or similar work that is licensed under the GNU
 Lesser General Public License. When you include a library or
 derivative work in your own programs, the Library's GPL licensing
 terms apply to the Library itself, but not to your program.

 “The Lesser General Public License” refers to the GNU Lesser General
 Public License, version 3, or any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.

 1. Source Code.

 The source code for a work is the preferred form for making
 modifications to it. The source code must be made available to the
 licensee either directly or indirectly, and the source code must be
 licensed under this License. For any work in object code form, the
 source code must be made available in a manner that is suitable for
 making modifications, such as through a version control system.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 The primary goal of this License is to make sure that you have the
 freedom to share and change free software. To achieve this goal, the
 License ensures that you have the following rights:

   a) You may copy, distribute, and modify the Program under the terms of
      this License.
   b) You may use the Program for any purpose.
   c) You may distribute copies of the Program, including modified
      versions, under the terms of this License.
   d) You may incorporate the Program into other works, provided that
      you comply with the terms of this License.

 3. Copyleft.

 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
 rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

 4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a modified version of the Program under the terms of
 this License, provided that you meet the following requirements:

   a) You must include the same copyright notice and license terms as
      in the original work.
   b) You must include a prominent notice stating that you have changed
      the files.
   c) You must include the date of the changes.

 5. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey the Program in object code or executable form under
 the terms of this License, provided that you meet the following
 requirements:

   a) You must include the source code or make it available to
      the recipients.
   b) You must include a copy of this License with the Program.
   c) You must include a prominent notice stating that the Program is
      licensed under the GNU GPL and that it comes with no warranty.

 6. Additional Terms.

 You may not impose any additional restrictions on the recipients' rights
 granted under this License. For example, you may not impose any
 terms that would limit the recipients' ability to use, modify, or
 distribute the Program.

 7. No Warranty.

 The Program is distributed without any warranty of any kind. There
 is no warranty for fitness for a particular purpose or any other
 warranty. You may use the Program at your own risk.

 8. Termination.

 If you violate any of the terms of this License, your rights under
 the License will terminate automatically. However, if you correct the
 violation within 30 days, you may regain your rights under the
 License.

 9. Interpretation.

 If any provision of this License is found to be invalid or
 unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue to apply. The
 License will be interpreted to give effect to its purposes and
 intentions.

 10. Governing Law.

 This License will be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts,
 without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

 11. GNU General Public License Versions.

 If you have received this License, you may choose to use any version
 of the GNU General Public License published by the Free Software
 Foundation. You may also use any later version that the Free Software
 Foundation may publish.

 12. Acceptance.

 By using, copying, or modifying the Program, you accept the terms of
 this License. If you do not agree to the terms, do not use, copy,
 or modify the Program.
